# Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree

This project focuses on building a **Decision Tree classification model** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and campaign-related features. The model is developed using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** as part of the **SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship (Task 3)**.

## Dataset

* **Bank Marketing Dataset**
* Contains customer demographic details such as age, job, marital status, education, and marketing campaign information.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Google Colab**
* **pandas** – data loading and preprocessing
* **scikit-learn** – model building and evaluation
* **matplotlib / seaborn** – visualization

## Project Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Build a **Decision Tree Classifier**
5. Train and evaluate the model
6. Analyze predictions and model performance

## Objective

To predict customer purchase behavior using demographic data and gain hands-on experience with classification models and decision trees.

## Outcome

This project helped in understanding:
* Classification techniques
* Decision Tree algorithms
* Feature preprocessing
* Model training and evaluation
